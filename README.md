# Soda-Vending-Machine
This VHDL project simulates a soda vending machine using a Mealy machine behavior model. The vending machine manages currency input, product requests, change dispensing, and maintains the internal state based on user actions. It's designed for FPGA implementation, offering a practical example of a state machine in digital systems design.
